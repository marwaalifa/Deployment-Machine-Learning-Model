Conducting the data mining process on Amazon Alexa Reviews involves transforming raw data into a structured Positive & Negative dataset. This intricate journey begins with thorough preprocessing to refine the data, followed by meticulous labeling. 
1    2741
0     409
Name: Sentiment, dtype: int64

1 : Positive 
0 : Negative

The labeling phase categorizes sentiments into two distinct classes: positive sentiment and negative sentiment. Subsequently, the dataset undergoes a model split, a crucial step in preparing for the final classification report. Through this comprehensive approach, we aim to extract valuable insights and nuances from the reviews, allowing for a nuanced understanding of sentiments expressed by users.
